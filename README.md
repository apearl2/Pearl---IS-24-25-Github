10/5-10/6 - Importance radio value works, begin learning about web scraping using Beautiful soup

10/13- Ability to search google and get any desired URL (CODE REUSABILITY), beginning to parse HTML data from Princeton Review (Niche doesnâ€™t work yet) using python string methods

10/14 - Finish string methods for rankings, final list generated for any Princeton Review ranking (with about 4 errors per 25)

10/19 -> Created function to create finalList to assign names and points (works for 2 lists so far) and cleaned up main function as well as ----Errors in list

10/20 -> Revised rankingA() function to ensure all colleges (tested with 4 PrincetonReview functions) are show in finalList once with their proper values
#And started making code to return ordered list of College Factual Rankings (turns out to be way easier than Princeton Review)
            
10/21 -> Built CollegeFactual() function up to generating a newrankList

10/24 -> rankingA() now works with CollegeFactual Function,             Started working with Flask

10/31 -> Video of current functionality

11/2 -> (Marked as ### in program) Used functionality of listA() function combined with google to compile complete lists of all colleges that might come up, and then now able to convert them without using google
        #Program now runs (with all 14 attributes) in about 45 seconds

11-3 -> Add project to GitHub, first Flask project with user input
